# TEMPL8S

Workout Tracking app built in REACT. This is meant to be used to record workouts of given routines. Simply keep track of your current workout by tapping an empty set button to indicate you have finished the set. If you failed your set, you can continue tapping until you reach the amount of reps you completed. If the set is completely finished, Templ8s will automatically update the weight for next time you do that workout. 

View a visualization of your progress by visiting the progress page which shows progress in any given lift you have completed.
